# Facility Location Problem - Reinforcement Learning Approach

## Description

This repository contains an implementation of Q-Leaning - a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach - to solve the Facility Location Problem (FLP). The RL agent learns to make decisions about facility placements based on demand data and problem constraints.

## Prerequisites

- GCC compiler
- Make
- Bash shell
- Python (for data analysis and visualization)
- Matplotlib (for results plotting)
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- NumPy (for numerical computations)

## Perform experiment

```shell
bash run_testing.sh
```
